# Firs-Fire


## Hello, what is this?

Firs & Fire is a small game. It is boardgame-like in the sense that you have cards, (character and monster), a die and a map.
You will get a random map, random characters and random monsters. You will walk across the map according to what you rolled on the die.

## Can you show me some functionality?

Sure, let's go trough it.

### Make rounds

This die here is what you will press to get a random event. Most events will only give you a text.

But eventually the gaming screen will be taken over by a battle with a monster.

The button "Character turn" means that the top character (on the left) will attack the monster. Press that and the button will change to "Monster turn".
This will happen until either reaches 0, ending the battle. Did you win? Great. Then you can move on and find the other three monsters. Did you die?
Do you have any characters left? Great. The next character in line will take over from you. No? Game over.

### What is the games purpose?

To fight monsters! There are three regular monsters, and one boss. Fights the first three, and the next time you roll a monsterevent the boss will pop up.
Defeat it, and the game is finished.

### The game is hard/easy

Sorry, my calculation formulas are maybe not the best. I will work on making a more fair battle system.

### The game is ugly

Beauty is subjective.

## I want to continue develope/make changes

You are free to use this app/module how you want to, if you want to add functionality or change things for the better.
There is no obligation to tell me, though I'd appreciate it. 

### Can I use seperate components from this?

You can take whatever class/function you want and put it inside your own. 

### If I want you to change something?

Things can always improve I know. Further down I have a list of things I want to change/implement.
